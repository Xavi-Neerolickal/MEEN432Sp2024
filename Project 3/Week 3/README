How to Run:
1. Download every file in Week 3
2. The files without '_Highway' for runsim and the simulink are for the Urban Data
3. Run all the init files
4. Run the normal p3_w3_car Simulink file
5. Run the normal p3_runsim MATLAB file
6. Run the p3_w3_Highwy simulink file
7. Run the p3_runsim_Highway file
8. Should produce the graphs for each with regenerative breaking applied.

Work Done:
1. Created the battery that outputs the state of charge and voltage from the current as the input function
using capacitance and internal resistance along with OCV values. The power loss and energy loss are 
put to workspace in the simulink file. The delays were placed appropriately for it to run
2. Created the Electric motor that takes in APP, motor speed and Bus voltage to output the motor torque,
motor intertia nd current of the bus channel.This was achieved by using the motor torque and efficiency
arrays. Appropriate delays were placed after the current generation function. The motor energy and 
power and outputted to the workspace inside this subsystem. 
3. Applied regenerative breaking of 0.1 inside the Driver function. The APP% of breaking was reduced by 
0.1 and added to the APP of torque/throttle. 
4. The Drive function multiplied the input functions by final drive gear ration (FDG) as required 
to produce the needed outputs.
