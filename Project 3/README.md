Project 3 Week 1:

For this week's progress update, we have completed Project 3 Week 1's deliverables and are starting the groundwork for Week 2's deliverables. After week 1, the group attended two office hours to understand the direction and desires of Project 3. The office hours were able to help the team fix previous code from previous projects and have set a good foundation moving forward into weeks 2 and 3. In this file, the team has completed the longitudinal simulation and built the simple driver model to drive the vehicle across two EPA cycles. As of right now, the group is building the electric vehicle powertrain model and integrating it with the longitudinal vehicle simulation. The group is anticipating learning more to complete week 2 deliverables following this week's lectures.
