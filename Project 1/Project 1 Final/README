For part 1 of the project, utilize project1_week3_sim.slx
We have 384 plots for omega, 192 plots for cpu time, and we have the expression for error calculated in the matlab. However, we could not finish plotting it.
For part 2 of the project, use project1_final.slx
We did not understand what tau_L was when using option 1. So, we hardcoded a random number as an input to out stiffness block in simulink
