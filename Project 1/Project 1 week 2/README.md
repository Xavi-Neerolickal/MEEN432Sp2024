The current MATLAB code that we have uploaded here creates 250001 graphs. This is because the size of the W_DOT is 250001x1. We are working on fixing it but we seem to fall short of it today. This could be 
changed with minor changes on the for loop. We have added and captured all the variables. 

# Week 2 Feedback (5/5)
I see there were some issues for this week deliverables. I want to first note that the simulink model that is being used in the sim function on line 15 does not correspond to the simulink model that was submitted. There is also an empty string in the solver array which can cause problems when calling the sim function since there would not be a solver for the model. I mentioned this last week and will mention it again, please review your script before submitting. There is a lot left for Part 1 that needs to be done so I urge your team to try to get that accomplished as soon as possible. Regarding Part 2 of the project, the team will need to create different simulink models for each of the options on how to add System 2 to System 1. Once the rest of Part 1 and Part 2 is complete, make sure to commit both Part 1 and Part 2 files with the commit message "Project 1 Final"
