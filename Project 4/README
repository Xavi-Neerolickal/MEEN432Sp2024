To run:

Run the init files, the simulink and then the MATLAB file. 

Issues: The violation for regenerative breaking still stays true for any speed > 5. I tried a linear equation
of line, however, that caused the breaking to completely fail and the car went off track, with high speeds
and started making loops near the curves. Hence, we kept the regeneraative breaking to a faulty code 
that does not really work. This is evident in how we have phrased the code right now so that it works 
in every other criteria.

Sucesses: The max SOC is 90% and the min SOC is around 60% which is above 10%. We used a 1 speed transmission
and the car runs 20 loops around the track in 60 mins. We have tried to incorporate raceStat and 
simulation into the MATLAB function. 

P.S: This mightve been the issue with our linear equation: We tried getting a positive slope when it should've
been negative. I did not add that code in the submission since it kept crashing our entire code. 

Thank you for all your help throughout the semester!
