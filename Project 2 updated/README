We took notes down during the office hours to troubleshoot and fix up our code and simulink. 
1) We ended up fixing the track by making adjustments to the x and y coordinates. The track has been transformed by 500 units of x to the right. This track was also added our Projecr2_final file so that the car is displayed being driven on the track. 
2) We fixed the driver sub-system in the simulink by changing the wheelbase of the car. The "L" variable within the driver sub-system has been set to "L=lf+lr" to reflect the length of the wheelbase of the vehicle
3) We also adjusted and found the optimum velocity so that the car is able to drive around the track without going out of bounds
