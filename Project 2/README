What has been run so far?
We created the track and a patch for the car to follow the lines of the track
What needs to be done?
1. Make the car go right direction
2. Create a trail of the path the car goes through
3. Make the car rotate in the curves
How to run?
Straightforward, download and run. No files or simulink files are added as of now

Short Report

The project has been progressing better than project one. We were able to create the track with
adivce from chatgpt and MATLAB website. Utilizing linspace and patch functions, we were able to 
create the track and the rectangular car that follows the track. However, the way the track is created,
it dissaciates itself at the corners of its curves. This is something we are working on right now. We
are also working on making use of the animate command to create the trail traced by the car. Parts of
this is visible as comments in the code file. The current iteration just makes the car bigger and 
does not create the required trace. The same is said for the rotate function. We have not figured 
out a way to assimilate the program in the demos file to our file. As for running our file, 
downloading and clicking run would be the best way. It is pretty straigtforward since it does not 
link any Simulink files.
