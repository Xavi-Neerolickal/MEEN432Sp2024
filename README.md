Week 3 Project Two Report:

In Project Two, the deliverables were to utilize MATLAB and Simulink to develop a race car around a track with two curves and two straights forming a NASCAR-like track. Developing our "lateral dynamic" and "Driver" systems in Simulink, our race car was able to navigate the track created. In our work in week 1, our track did not perform well enough. As a result, we started our track from scratch by dividing it into four sections. After completing this, we added the "Driver" and " Lateral dynamic" codes to the Simulink. Developing these, we ran into more issues regarding the track path and the Simulink was generating more errors. 

In Week 3, we incorporated the "raceStat" and "init" files to provide the vehicle's statistics. Using these statistics, we improved the Simulink performance where the car ran through the track while rotating with less errors.
